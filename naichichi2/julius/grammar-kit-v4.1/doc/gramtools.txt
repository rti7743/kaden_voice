These are tools for building recognition grammar for Julius.
Julius uses original grammar format.

  mkdfa (mkdfa.pl)  grammar compiler.
  generate	    randam sentence generation tool.
  accept_check	    tool to check acception/rejection of input sentence.
  nextword	    display next predicted words of given partial sentence.
  gram2sapixml	    perl script to convert Julius grammar to SAPI XML format.


To know how to write a grammar for Julius and about the file formats,
please see Grammar.txt for details.

How to compile

These tools are distributed as part of Julius.  Compiling Julius from
the parent directory also compile these tools.

The below tools and libraries are needed to compile and run these tools.

	- perl (ver.5 and later)
	- GNU bison
	- GNU flex
	- GNU readline library
	- iconv
	- Jcode.pm (only for gram2sapixml)

mkdfa.pl --- Grammar compiler

  mkdfa.pl compiles the Julius format grammar (.grammar and
  .voca) to Julius native formats (.dfa and .dict).

  Assume the .grammar file and .voca file has the same prefix
  (i.e. "foo.grammar" and "foo.voca"), mkdfa.pl compiles them to the
  Julius native format in the way below:

  ----------------------------------------------------
  % mkdfa.pl foo
  ----------------------------------------------------
  Then it generates files "foo.dfa" and "foo.dict" in the same
  directory.  It also generates terminal symbol information in
  "foo.term" that can be used other grammar tools.

  The mkdfa.pl is a script to spawn the core compile "mkfa", so you
  need "mkfa" at the same directory of "mkdfa.pl".


======================================================================
generate --- Randam sentence generator

  This small program randomly generates sentences that are acceptable
  by the given grammar.  It can be used to check coverage of a
  grammar in a human basis, by looking up if it may generate
  non-acceptable sentences.

  .dfa, .dict and .term files are needed to execute.  They can be
  generated from .grammar and .voca file by mkdfa.pl.

  Options: 
	"-n num" specifies the number of sentence to be generated
		 (default: 10)
	"-t"	 output in terminal name rather than word name (needs
		.term file)

  ----- Example ------------------------------------------------

    % generate ../sample_grammars/vfr/vfr
    Reading in dictionary...done
    Reading in DFA grammar...done
    Mapping dict item <-> DFA terminal (category)...done
    Reading in term file (optional)...done
    42 categories, 99 words
    DFA has 135 nodes and 198 arcs
    ----- 
    (sentences will be generated here...)

  --------------------------------------------------------------

======================================================================
accept_check  --- Check acception or rejection of sentences

  "accept_check" is a tool to check whether a sentence (word sequence) is
  acceptable on the given grammar.  Given a grammar, each input from
  the standard input is parsed line by line and output whether they
  are acceptable or not.

  .dfa, .dict and .term files are needed to execute.  They will be
  generated from .grammar and .voca file by mkdfa.pl.

  Usage: the grammar should be specified as the same style as
  mkdfa.pl, i.e., the prefix of .dfa, .dict and .term should be
  specified.  See the examples below.

---- Example ---------------------------------------------
    % bin/accept_check ../sample_grammars/vfr/vfr
    Reading in dictionary...done
    Reading in DFA grammar...done
    Mapping dict item <-> DFA terminal (category)...done
    Reading in term file (optional)...done
    42 categories, 99 words
    DFA has 135 nodes and 198 arcs
    ----- 
    please input word sequence>silB hello silE              <-- input
    wseq: silB hello silE
    cate: NS_B GREETING NS_E
    accepted
    please input word sequence>
---------------------------------------------------------

  Input sentence should be a sequence of space-saprated words.  The
  short pause model (pronunciation given as "sp") in grammar will be
  treated specially to allow skip. 

  If there are several words in dictionary that matches the given
  word, all the possible combination will be tried to check acceptability.

  Specifying "-t" option at startup time will enable category label as
  an input.


======================================================================
nextword --- display next predicted words

  Given a partial (part of) sentence from the end, it outputs
  the next words allowed in the specified grammar.

  .dfa, .dict and .term files are needed to execute.  They will be
  generated from .grammar and .voca file by mkdfa.pl.

  !NOTE! The sentence should be specified from the END OF SENTENCE,
	 because Julius does right-to-left parsing.

---- Example ---------------------------------------------
    % bin/nextword ../sample_grammars/vfr/vfr
    Reading in dictionary...done
    Reading in DFA grammar...done
    Mapping dict item <-> DFA terminal (category)...done
    Reading in term file (optional)...done
    42 categories, 99 words
    DFA has 135 nodes and 198 arcs
    ----- 
    wseq > afternoon silE				<-- input
    [wseq: afternoon silE]
    [cate: AFTERNOON NS_E]
    PREDICTED CATEGORIES/WORDS:
                NS_B (silB)
                GOOD (good)
    wseq >
--------------------------------------------------------

  You can use completion and history for wseq input, which is a
  function of GNU readline library.  The important keys are:

	TAB		completion of dictionary word.  When invoking
			with "-t" option, completion will be category name.
	Ctrl-P, Ctrl-N	history up/down.
